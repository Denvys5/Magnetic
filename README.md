# Magnetic
This is a simulation of charged particles.
There are elementary particles that have charge and mass. Particles with the same charge are repelled, and particles with different charges are attracted.
Several particles can form a molecule (2 or more particles that do not change their coordinates relative to each other). Molecules can rotate. Each particle of a molecule interacts with each particle of another molecule. Particles of one molecule do not interact with each other.
